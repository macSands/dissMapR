`dissMapR` is an R package designed to streamline the assessment, mapping, and prediction of compositional dissimilarity and biodiversity turnover. It integrates multi-site dissimilarity metrics - particularly zeta diversity - and advanced modelling approaches, such as Multi-Site Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (MS-GDM), to evaluate how biodiversity patterns respond to environmental drivers at multiple spatial scales.

This project is part of the [B3 (B-Cubed) project](https://b-cubed.eu/), a Europe-wide collaboration dedicated to advancing robust biodiversity indicators for more effective policy and decision-making. In addition to this repository, `dissMapR` will be hosted on the [B-Cubed GitHub organization](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu).

## Features

- **Automated Data Integration**
  - Retrieve species occurrence data from
    [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)  
  - Access environmental variables from sources like
    [WorldClim](https://worldclim.org/) and
    [CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org/)
- **Compositional Turnover Metrics**
  - Calculate pairwise and multi-site dissimilarity (zeta diversity,
    Bray–Curtis, etc.)  
  - Model turnover using MS-GDM to link species composition with spatial
    and environmental gradients
- **Predictive Modeling & Visualization**
  - Project changes in community composition or “bioregions” under
    different environmental scenarios  
  - Generate interactive or static maps of turnover “hotspots” and
    emergent bioregions

## Why Use `dissMapR`?

1.  **Reproducible Workflows**  
    Automates data retrieval, cleaning, and modeling to reduce error and
    save time.

2.  **Beyond Alpha and Beta Diversity**  
    Emphasizes multi-site connectivity (zeta diversity), capturing
    compositional patterns often overlooked by simpler metrics.

3.  **Scalable and Flexible**  
    Adaptable to diverse datasets and spatial extents, from local to
    continental scales.

4.  **Decision-Support Ready**  
    Maps of predicted turnover and delineated bioregions can inform
    conservation priorities, climate adaptation plans, and biodiversity
    policies.

## Example Application

Below is a brief overview of how `dissMapR` can be applied to butterfly
occurrence data in southern Africa:

1.  **Data Access**
    - Automated retrieval of occurrence records via GBIF  
    - Environmental data (e.g., temperature, precipitation) from
      WorldClim
2.  **Multi-Site Metrics**
    - Computation of zeta diversity to assess the proportion of shared
      species across multiple sites  
    - Calculation of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity and others for broader
      context
3.  **MS-GDM**
    - Linking environmental gradients (e.g., climate variables) with
      biodiversity turnover  
    - Predicting compositional changes under future environmental
      scenarios
4.  **Visualization**
    - Mapping of high-turnover “hotspots” and distinct bioregional
      clusters  
    - Identifying potential zones of rapid community shift under climate
      change
      
## Installation

You can install the development version of dissMapR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Coming soon:
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("b-cubed-eu/dissMapR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dissMapR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
